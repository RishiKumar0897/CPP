- the char data type was designed to hold a single character 
    - a character is a single letter, number, symbol, or whitespace

- char data type is an integral type, meaning the underlying value is stored as an integer

- the integer stored by a char variable is interpreted according to the ASCII table

- char ch{'a'};
    - alternatively can initialized using ASCII code number, but generally frowned upon


- it is inputted and outputted as a character, not the code number

- when input is extracted, whitespace is ignored
    - we can use std::cin.get(ch) to not ignore whitespace

- a char is 1 byte in size
- some chars have meaning as escape sequences
    - an example of this is '\n' for newline
    - another example is '\t' for tab 

- there is a whole table full of escape characters with many different Users

- single characters should be single-quoted
- avoid multicharacter literals
