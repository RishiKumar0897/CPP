- C++ provides an alternate set of integer types that are guaranteed to be the same size on any architecture

- fixed-width integers
    std::int8_t -> 1 byte signed
    std::int16_t -> 2 byte signed
    std::int32_t -> 4 byte signed
    std::int64_t -> 8 byte signed

- as a warning, std::int8_t typically behaves like a char 

- downsides of fixed-width
    1. not guaranteed to be defined on all architectures
    2. may be slowe than a wider type on some architectures

- to help address these downsides, C++ provides an alternative set of integers that are GUARANTEED to exist

- fast type std::int_fast#_t gives the fastest signed integer type with a width of at least # bits
    - fastest meaning it's processed most quickly by the CPU

- you should avoid the fast and least integer types because they will exhibit different behaviors on different architectures

Best practice
    - prefer int when size of integer doesn't matter
    - prefer std::int#_t when storing a quantity that needs a guaranteed range
    - prefer std::uint#_t when doing bit manipulation or well-defined wrap-around behavior is required

    - avoid short and long integers
    - fast and least types
    - 8-bit fixed-width integer types (just use char)
    - any compiler-specific fixed-width integers
