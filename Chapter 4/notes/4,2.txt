- void = no type

- void is an example of an incomplete type 
    - an incomplete type is a type that has been declared but hasn't been defined
    - compiler knows of these types' existence, but not enough info to determine how much memory to allocate or how to treat int

- incomplete types cannot be instantiated
- void is most commonly used to indicate that a function does not return a value
