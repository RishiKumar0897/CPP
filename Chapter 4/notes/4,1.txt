- the smallest unit of memory is a binary digit (bit).
    - holds a value of 0 or 1

- memory is organized into sequential units called memory addresses
    - each memory address holds 1 byte of data
        - a byte has 8 bits


- we use a data type to tell the compiler how to interpret the contents of memory in some meaningful way

- primitive data types:
    - float
    - bool
    - char 
    - int 
    - std::nullptr_t (null pointer)
    - void


- C++ contains 3 sets of types
    - primitive types (as listed above)
    - compound types are more complex, and include user-created types
    - standard library types
