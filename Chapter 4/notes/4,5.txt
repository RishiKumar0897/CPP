- C++ also supports unsigned integers, which only hold non-negative numbers
    - declare like this -> unsigned int x;

- an n-bit unsigned integer's value is 0 to 2(n-1) - 1
- when an unsigned integer overflows, it wraps around
    - so for example for an 8-bit unsigned integer, 255 is the largest number
    - if you set it to 256, it wraps around and becomes 0

- generally should avoid using unsigned numbers because it's easier to cause overflow issues
    - also avoid mixing signed and unsigned numbers


- there are a few cases in C++ where we can use unsigned numbers
    - preferred when dealing with bit manipulation
    - useful when well-defined wrap-around behavior is required
    - array indexing
    - embedded systems for performance reasons
