- an integer is an integral type that represents positive and negative whole numbers (including 0)

- C++ has 4 primitive integer types
    - short int
    - int
    - long int
    - long long int


- integers in C++ are signed by default (pos, neg, or 0)

- an n-bit signed variable has a range of -(2^n-1) to 2(n-1) - 1
    - assumes two's complement binary representation (which is standard for modern architecture)


- if we try to assign a value that is outside the range of an n-bit integer, it results in undefined behavior (overflow)

- overflow generally results in information being lost
- when doing integer division, C++ always produces an integer results
    - any fractional portion is dropped (not rounded)
