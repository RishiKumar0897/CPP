- most objects will take up more than 1 byte of memory
- the amount of memory that an object uses is based on its data type

-the more memory can object uses, the more information it can hold

- an object with n bits can hold 2^n unique values (0 or 1)

- primitive data type sizes:
    -  an object must occupy at least 1 byte
    - a byte must be at least 8 bits
    - char, short, int, long, long long -> 8, 16, 16, 32, 64 bits
    - char is exactly 1 byte


- bool = 1 byte
- char = 1 byte
- short = 2 bytes
- int = 4 bytes
- long = 4 bytes
- long long = 8 bytes
- float = 4 bytes
- double = 8 bytes
- std::nullptr_t = 4 bytes 


- sizeof() is a unary operator that takes a type or a variable and returns the size of it in bytes
- sizeof() does not account for dynamically allocated memory
