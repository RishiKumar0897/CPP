- if statements allow us to execute one or more lines of code only if some condition is true

syntax
    - if (condition)
        statements;

- a condition (or conditional expression) is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value

- if the condition evalues to true, we executes the statement, if it evaluates to false then we skip it

- you can add an else clause if you want a series of statements to execute if the condition is false
    - this gets into chaining -> if, else if (as many as you want), else


- a return statement that idn't the last sttement in a function is called an early return
    - we can use if statements to cause early returns in functions for efficiency or recursion purposes or error conditions
