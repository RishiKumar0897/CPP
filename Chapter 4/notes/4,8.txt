- a floating point type variable is a variable that holds a number with a fractional component

- there are types of floating point data types 
    - single precision float -> 4 bytes
    - double precision double -> 8 bytes
    - longer precision double -> 8-16 bytes

- we should avoid using the long double (double double) if possible 

- when creating and initializing a float variable, make sure you include at least one decimal place
    - this is to avoid unnecessary type conversions that may result in loss of data and precision


- the precision of a floating point type refers to how many significant digits it can represent without information loss
    - i.e. a float has 6-9 digits of precision, meaning it can exactly represent any number with up to 6 sig figs, and definitely nothing over 9

- when outputting floating point numbers, std::cout has a default precision of 6
    - it assumes all floating point variables are only significant to 6 digits
    - it will truncate anything after that

- you can use an output manipulator function to alter how data is output
    - you can override the default precision for std::cout using std::setprecision()
    - once you set an output manipulator it remains set

- favor double over a float unless space is a constraint
- rounding errors occur when a number can't be stored precisely
    - BE WARY USING FLOATS FOR FINANCIAL DATA 


- posinf and neginf represent positive and negative infinity
- NaN stands for not a number
