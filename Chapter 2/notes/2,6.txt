- functions provide a number of benefits that make them usefil in programs of longer length and complexity

- Organization
    - as programs grow in complexity, using functions helps to simplify understanding and compartmentalization, making it more manageable and less complex

- Reusability
    - once a function is written, it can be called anh number of times. reduces duplications and unnecessary copy/paste errors

- Testing
    - makes it easier to test code, as you can unit test your functions and ensure it works

- Extensibility
    - makes it easier to extend our program to handle a case it hasn't handled before

- Abstraction
    - to use a function, you only need to know its name, inputs, outputs, and where it lives


- groups os statements that appear more than once in a program should be made into a function
- code that has a well-defined set of inputs and outputs should be made into a function

- a function performs one task
- when a function becomes too long/too complicated, it should be split into multiple sub-functions
    - this is known as refactoring
