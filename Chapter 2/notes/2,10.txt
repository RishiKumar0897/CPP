- prior to compilation, each .cpp file goes through a preprocessing phase.
- in this phase, a program called the preprocessor makes various changes to the text of the code file
- the preprocessor does not actually modify the original code

- preprocessor strips out comments, and ensures each code file ends in a newline
- the preprocessor's most important job is processing the #include directives at the top of our code files

- when the preprocessor has finished processing a file, the result is called a translation unit

- the entire process of preprocessing, compiling, and linking is called translation

- preprocessor directives are instructions that start with a # symbol and end with a newline
    - these directives tell the preprocessor to perform certain text manipluation tasks


- preprocessor does not understand C++ syntax

- #include is an example of a directive.
    - the preprocessor replaces #include with the contents of the included file, which are then preprocessed, after which the rest of your file is preprocessed


- a macro is a rule that defines how input text is converted into replacement output text
- we use #define to create a macro


- function-like macros act like functions and serve a similar purpose (NEVER USE THESE)
- object-like macros are defined in one of two ways
    - #define IDENTIFIER 
    - #define IDENTIFIER substitution_text

- the identifier for a macro uses the same naming rules as normal identifiers: letters, numbers, underscores
    - macro names should be written in all uppercase letters


- conditional compilation preprocessor directives allow you to specify under what conditions something will or won't compile


- #ifdef allows preprocessor to check whether an identifier has been previously defined via #define
    - if so, the block of code between #ifdef and #endif is compiled


- #ifndef is the opposite of #ifdef

- #if 0 excludes a block of code from being compiled
    - #if 1 makes sure a block is ALWAYS compiled


- directives are resolved before compulation from top to bottom
