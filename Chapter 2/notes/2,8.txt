- as programs get larger, it is common to split them into multiple files for reusability and organizational purposes
- make sure to use forward declarations to avoid compiler errors

- compiler compiles each file individually, so it doesn't know about contents of other files or remember anything it has seen from previously compiled files
- limited visibility and short memory is intentional
    - allows source files to be compiled in any order
    - when we change a source file, only that specific file needs to be recompiled
    - reduces the possibility of naming conflicts between identifiers in different files
