- a function is not just a collection of statements that execute sequentially
- it's also a reusable sequence of statements, designed to do a particular job


- functions written by the user are user-defined functions
- a function call tells the CPU to interrupt the current function and execute another function
- CPU essentially puts a bookmark at the current point of execution, executes the function named in the function call, and then returns to the original point to resume

- the function initiating the function call is the caller, the function being called is the callee

- basic syntax for a user-defined function 
    - returnType functionName() {
        #some logic
    }


    - first line is called the function header
        - tells the compiler about function's existence, name, and return type
    - the statements between the curly braces are called the function body

    

- in C++, nested functions are not supported
