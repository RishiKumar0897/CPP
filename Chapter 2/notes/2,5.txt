- variables defined inside the body of a function are called local variables
    - function parameters are also considered to be local variables

- local variables are created and initialized at the point of definition
- local variables are destroyed in the OPPOSITE ORDER of creation at the end of the function

- an object's lifetime is the time between its creation and destruction
    - variable creation and destruction happen when program is running, not at compile time
    - therefore, liftetime is a runtime property

- when an object is destroyed, it becomes invalid to reference
    - any use of the object after it has been destroyed results in undefined behavior
    - at some point afterdestruction the memory that the objects took up will be deallocated 

- an identifier's scope determines where it can be seen and used within the code 
- scope is a compile-time property
- an identifier with local scope is usable from point of definition to the end of the innermost pair of curly braces containing the identifier
- ensures that local variables cannot be used or accessed before the point of definition, or after destruction

- out of scope -> identifier cannot be accessed within the code
- going out of scope -> applied to objects rather than identifiers, happens at the end of the scope in which object was instantiated



- a temporary object is an unnamed object that is used to hold a value only needed for a short period of time
