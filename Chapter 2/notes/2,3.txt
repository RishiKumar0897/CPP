- void return type is used to tell the comiler that a function does not return a value
    -ex:

    void printHi() {
        std::cout << "Hi" << '\n';
    }


- the function will have a useful behavior to the caller, but won't have to return anything upon function end
- this means that void functions do not need a return statement
    - alternatively, you can use "return;" with no return value

- void functions cannot be used in expressions that reauire a value
- returning a value from a void function is a compile error
