- compiler compiles the contents of a file sequentially
    - that is, variables and functions must be defined before they are called

- alternatively, we can use a forward declaration to tell the compiler about the existence of an identifier before actually defining it
    - this way, when the compiler encounters the function, it understands that we're making a function call

- to make a forward declaration, we use a function declaration statement
    - this consists of the header followed by a semicolon (no body)

- example function declaration: int add(int x, int y);


int add (int x, int y);

int main() {
    std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is: " << add(3, 4) << '\n'
}

int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}


- we use forward declarations gdnerally to tell the compiler about the existence of a function that has been defined in a different code file.
    - in this case, reordering isn't possible


- forward declarations can also be used to define our functions in an order-agnostic manner, allowing us to define functions in whatever order maximizes Organization

- declaration vs definition
    - declaration: tells the compiler about the existence of an identifier and it's type information
    - definition: a declaration that actually implements or instantiates the identifier

- one definition rule (ODR)
    - within a file, each function, variable, type, or template in a given scope can only have one definition
    - within a program, each function or variable in a given scope can only have one definition
    - Types, templates, inline functions, and inline variables are allowed to have duplicate definitions in different files, so long as each definition is identical
