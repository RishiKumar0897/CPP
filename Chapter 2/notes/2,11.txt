- header files have a .h extension
- they allow us to put declarations in one place, and then import them wherever we need to use them


- when you #include a file, the content of the included file is inserted at the point of inclusion

- header files consists of two parts
    1. header guard
    2. actual content of the header file, which are the forward declarations for all the identifiers we want other files to be able to serve



example

add.h

    int add(int x, int y);

main.cpp

    #include "add.h"
    #include <iostream>

    int main() {
        std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is " << add(3,4) << '\n';
        return 0;
    }


add.cpp

    #include "add.h"
    int add(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
    }


- do not put function and variable definitions in your header files
    - doing so is a violation of the one-definition rule


- source files should include their paired header
    - this allows the compiler to catch certain kinds of errors at compiler time instead of link time


- do not #include .cpp files
    - causes naming collisions between source files
    - makes it hard to avoid ODR violations
    - any change to a .cpp file will cause both that file and other .cpp files that includes it to recompile which takes a long time

- use double quotes to include header files that we've written ourselves or are found in the current directory
- use angled brackets to include headers that come with your compiler, OS< or third-party libraries


- when we #include a header file, we also include any other header files that are #included by that header
- these additional header files are known as transitive includes


- best practice is to explicity #include all header filesneeded for program to compile

- order of inclusion for header files 
    1. paired header file for this code file (add.cpp should #include add.h)
    2. other headers from the same project
    3. 3rd party library headers
    4. standard library headers
