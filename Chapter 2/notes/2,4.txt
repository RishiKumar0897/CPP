- it's useful to be able to pass information TO a function being called
    - we do this via function parameters/arguments

- a function parameter is a variable used in the header
    - work almost identically to variables defined inside the function, but they are initialized with a value provided by the caller
    - they are defined in the function header after the function name, separated by commas
    - i.e. -> void printValue(int x, int y)


- an argument is a vzlue passed from the caller to the function when a call is made
    - i.e. -> printValue(6);

- when a functino is caled, all of the parameters of the function are created as variables
- the value of each of the arguments is copied into the matching parameter
    - this process is called pass by value
    - function parameters that use pass by value are called value parameters

    - example
    void printValues(int x, int y) {
        std::cout << x << '\n';
        std::cout << y << '\n';

    }

    int main() {
        printValues(6, 7)
    }


    - the function parameters of printValues -> int x and int you
    - they have values passed to them via the function call inside main
    - thus their values become 6 and 7 respectively


- by using both parameters and return values, we can create functions that take data as input, manipulate that data, and return a new value to the caller
- unreferenced parameters are paraneters that are not used in the body of the function
- name of a function parameter is optional
    - in cases where a function parameter needs to exist but isn't actually used in the function, you can omit a name
    - these parameters are known as unnamed parameters
