- C++ requires that all identifiers be non-ambiguous
- if two identical identifiers are introduced into the same program in a way that the compiler or linker can't tell them apart, it will produce an error
    - this is referred to as a naming collision or naming conflict
    - if the conflict occurs in the same file it's a compiler error, and if the conflict occurs in separate files belonging to the same program, it's a linker error


- most naming collisions occur in two cases
    - two or more identically names functions (or globla variables) introduced into separate files belonging to the same program
    - two or more identically names functions (or global variables) introduced into the same file

- a scope region is an area of source code where all declared identifiers are distinct from names declared in other scopes

- a namespace allows you to declare or define names inside of it for the purpose of disambiguation
    - names declared in a namespace are isolated from names declared in other scopes
    - namespaces can only contain declarations and definitions


- any name that is not defined inside a class, function, or namespace is considered to be part of the global namespace (global scope)
    - identifiers declared inside the global scope are in scope from the point of declaration to the end of the file
    - although variables can be defined in the global namespace, it should be generally avoided

- :: is a scope resolution operator
    - for example in std::cout, it tells compiler that the identifier on the left is a namespace, and the identifier on the right is the variable/function being referenced
