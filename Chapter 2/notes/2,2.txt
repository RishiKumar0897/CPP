- when we write a user-defined function, we get to determine whether function will return a value back or not
- first, set the function's return type
- second, inside the function, we have a return statement that indicates the specific value/object we are returning to the caller
    - when it's executed, the return expression is evaluated, the value produced is copied and returned to the caller, and the function exits, returning control to the caller

- for the main() function, there are two special requirements
    1. main is required to return an int
    2. explicit function calls to main() are not allowed

- the return value from main() is called a status code
    - signals whether program was successful or not
    - status code of 0 means program ran successfully
    - a non-zero status code means there was some kind of failure

- a value-returning function that does not return a value will produce undefined behavior
- the main() function will implicitly return 0 if you don't provide a return statement
- functions can only return a single value
