- A computer program is a sequence of instructions that directs a computer to perform certain actions in a specified order
    - typically written in a programming language
- when a computer is performing the actions described the instructions in a computer program, we say it is running/executing

- programs are executed on a computer's hardware (physical components)
- software refers to programs on a system designed to executed on hardware

- platform refers to a compatible set of hardware and software that provides an environment for software to running

- a program that can be easily transferred from one platform to another is said to be portable
    - act of modifying a program so it runs on diff platforms is porting



- a computer's CPU is incapable of understanding C++
- only capable of processing instructions written in machine code
    - ISA (instruction set)
    - made up of binary digits (bits)

- assembly language is a programming language that essentially functions as a more human-readable machine language
    - assembly programs are translated into machine language before execution by an assembler


- Low Level languages
    - provide minimal abstraction from the architecture of the machine
    - lots of downsides
        - not portable
        - requires detailed knowledge of ISA and architecture
        - hard to understanding
        - hard to write programs of significant complexity, primitive capabilities

    - upside
        - super fast


- High Level languages
    - also must be translated into machine language
        - 2 ways: compiling and interpreting

    - Compilers
        - a program that reads source code of a high level language and translates into machine code
    - Interpreter
        - directly executes instructions in the source code without compilation first
        - more flexible, but much less efficient


    - high level of abstraction from underlying architecture
    - easier to read write and learn
    - include additional capabilities that make it easier to perform common programming tasks
