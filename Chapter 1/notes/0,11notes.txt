- when you write programs, compiler will check to ensure you are following the rules of C++
- If you write something that violates these rules, your program is ill-formed

- in most cases, it will emit some sort of diagnostic message. 
    - a diagnostic error means the compiler halts compilation due to not being able to proceeed or the error is serious enough to stop
    - a diagnostic warning means the compiler has decided not to halt compilation
        - issue is ignored and compilation proceeds

- diagnostic messages typically contain both the filename and line number where the compiler found the issue.
    - also includes some text for context about what was found
