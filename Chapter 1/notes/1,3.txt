Data and values
    - Data is any information that can be moved, processed, or stored by a computer

    - a program can acquire data in many ways
        - from a file
        - from a database
        - over a network
        - from user input
    - A single piece of data is called a value
    - Examples of values include
        - numbers
        - characters
        - text
    

    - Values placed directly into the source code are called literals




Random Access Memory
    - main memory in a computer is called Random Access Memory (RAM)
    - When a program is run, the OS loads program into the RAM
    - any data that is hardcoded into the program is loaded at this point
    - the OS also reserves a portion of the RAM for the program to use while it is running
    - Common uses for this memory are
        - store values entered by user
        - store data read in from a file or network
        - store values calculated during program runtime



Objects 

    - an object represents a region of storage that can hold a value.
    - objects also have associated properties
    - an object with a name is called a variable
    - objects are used to store a value in memory

    - a definition statement can be used to tell the compiler we want to use a variable in our program
        - int x;

    - at compile-time, compiler makes a note to itself that we want a variable with the name x, and that the data type is int


Variable Creation
    - at runtime, each object is given an actual storage location that it uses to store values
    - process of reservings torage for an object's future use is called allocation
    - an object is create once actual storage has been relegated for object's use



Data Types 
    - determines what kind of value the object will store
    - in C++ the type of an object must be known at compile-time
