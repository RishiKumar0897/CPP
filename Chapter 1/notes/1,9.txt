- literals are fixed values that have been inserted directly into the source code
- literals and variables both have a value and type
    - value of a literal is fixed and cannot be changed

- literal == constant
- a literal's value is placed directly into the executable, and thus since the executable can't be changed after it's created, neither can the literal's value
- a variable's value is placed in memory, and the value of memory can be changed while executable is running


- an operation is a process involving zero or more input values (operands) that produce an output value
- specific operation to be performed is denoted by an operator


- the output value of an operation is called the return value

- number of operands that an iperator takes as input is called the operator's arity
    - unary takes one
    - binary takes two
    - ternary takes 3 (only one is conditional operator)
    - nullary takes 0 (only one is the throw operator)

- operators can be chained together (works like PEMDAS)

- an operator that has an observable effect beyond producing a return value is said to have a side effect
