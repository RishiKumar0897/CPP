Variable Initialization

    - process of specifying an initial value for an object is called Initialization
    - syntax used to initialize an object is called an initializer

    - Copy Initialization
        - int width = 5;
        - a little older, but behaves the same way
    

    - Direct Initialization
        - int width (5);
        - more efficient

    
    - List Initialization
        - int width {5};
        - most modern version of Initialization
        - introduced to provide a syntax that works in almost all cases, behaves consistently
        - disallows narrowing conventions
            - if you try to initialize a variable using an invalid value, compiler will raise an error

- you should initialize your variables upon creation

- list initialization is preferred in modern C++

- instantion means a variable has been created and initialized (usually used for class type objects)

- you can initialize multiple variables on the same line
    - int e {9}, f{10};


- modern compilers will generate warnings if a variable is initialized but never used
    - you can avoid using [[maybe_unused]] to bypass This
