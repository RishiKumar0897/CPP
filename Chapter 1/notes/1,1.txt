Statements

    - a statement is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some action
    - by far the most common type of instruction in a C++ program
    - smallest independent unit of computation in C++
    - most statements in C++ end in a semicolon

    - many different kinds of Statements
        - declaration
        - jump
        - expression
        - compound
        - selection
        - iteration
        - try blocks



Functions 
    - statements are typically grouped into units called functions
    - a function is a collection of statements that get executed sequentially 
    - Every C++ program must have a special function named main 
        - when a program is run, statements inside main are executed in sequential order
        - programs terminate after the last statement in the main function

    - functions are typically created to do a specific job
    - the name of a function is called its identifier


Characters and text
    - a character is a written symbol or mark
        - i.e. letter, digit, punctuation
    - a sequence of characters is text (String)


#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   std::cout << "Hello world!";
   return 0;
}

- #include is a preprocessor directive tha tindicates that we want to use the iostream library
- std::cout << lets us display information on the console
