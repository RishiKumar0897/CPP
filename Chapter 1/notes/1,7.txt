    - these are called keywords
    - each of these hold special meaning to C++ language

- the name of a variable is called an identifier
    - naming rules
        - 1. cannot be a keyword
        - 2. can only consist of letters, numbers, and underscore
        - 3. must begin with a letter or underscore
