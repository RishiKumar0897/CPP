- whitespace refers to characters used for formatting purposes
    - i.e. spaces, tabs, and newlines

- in C++ whitespace is used for 3 things
    1. separating language elements
    2. inside text
    3. formatting code


- syntax of the language requires that some elements are separated by whitespace.
    - mostly occurs when two keywords or identifiers must be placed consecutively

- the amount of whitespace does not matter EXCEPT for inside quoted text.
- whitespace otherwise is ignored, so we use it to format our code and make it easy to read


- C++ does not enforce any kind of formatting restrictions
    - whitespace independent language

- most modern IDEs have automatic formatting as you type
