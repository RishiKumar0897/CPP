Summary of Chapter 1


    - a statement is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some actions
        - statements end with semicolons

    - a function is a collection of statements that execute sequentially.
        - every C++ program has a "main" function
    - name of a function, object, type, etc is called an identifier
    - rules that govern how elements in the C++ language are structured is called syntax
    - comments let you leave notes about the code and what it does
    - data is any information that can be moved, processed, or stored by the computer
        - a value is a single piece of data
    

    - a variable is a named piece of memory that we use to store values
        - to create variables, we use definition statements
        - when the program is run, each defined variable is instantiated
    
    - a data type tells the compiler how to interpret a piece of data into a meaningful value
        - an integer is a number that can be written without a decimal
    
    - copy assignment (using '=') is used to assign values to variables

    - specifiying an initial value for an object is called initialization


    - std::cout << lets us output the result of an expression to the console
    - std::cin >> lets us read input from the keyboard


    - a variable that hasn't been given a value is called an uninitialized variable
        - trying to get the value of an uninitialized variable results in undefined behavior
    
    - C++ reserves a set of words called keywords, which have special meaning for the language
    - a literal (constant) is a fixed value directly inserted into the source code

    - an operation is a process involving 0 or more input values (operands)
        - Types: nullary, unary, binary, ternary
    
    - an expression is a sequence of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that are evaluated to produce a single output value
        - the calculation of this output value is called evaluation
        - the value produced is the return value
    

    - an expression statement is an expression that has been turned into a statement by placing a semicolon at the end
