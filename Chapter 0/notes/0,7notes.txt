- a project is a container that holds all of your source code files, images, data files, etc 
    - also saves various IDE, compiler, and linker settings, as well as remembering saves


- compiling and running
    - cd "/Users/rishikumar/Desktop/C++/Chapter 1/code"
    - clang++ -std=gnu++17 -g -Wall HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld ./HelloWorld

- When a code file is compiled, IDE may cache the resulting object file on disk
    - a cache is a storage location where frequently accessed data is stored for fast retrieval later


- Build: compile all modified code files in the project or workspace, then link object files into an executable
- Clean: remove all cached objects and executables so the next time a project is built, all files will be recompiled
- Rebuild: clean, followed by a build
- Compile: recompiles a single code file
- Run: executes an executable from a build.
