- C++ standard defines rules about how programs should behave in specific circumstances. 
- In most cases, compilers follow these rules
- some compilers, however, will implement their own changes to the language to enhance compatibility with other versions of the language
    - these compiler-specific behaviors are called compiler extensions


- writing a program that uses a compiler extension lets you write programs that are incompatible with the C++ standard
- programs using non standard extensions generally will not compile on other compilers
