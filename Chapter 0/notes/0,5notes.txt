- in order to compile C++ files, we use a C++ compiler
- C++ compiler goes through each source code file in your program and does 2 things
    1. Checks C++ code to make sure it follows rules
    2. Translates C++ code into machine code (stored in an intermediate file called an object file)


- After compiler completes its tasks, a program called the linker executes
    - linker combines all object files and produces the desired executable output file
    - first, linker reads in each of the object files generated by compiler
    - then it ensures all dependencies across files are resolved properly
    - finally it outputs the desired output file (executable)


C++ Standard library
    - provides a set of useful capabilities for use in your programs
    - one of the most commonly used parts is the IO library


3rd party libraries
    - you can link third party libraries that are created by independent entities
    - these include capabilities that aren't included as part of the standard library

- rhte process of creating an executable program is known as building

- once you have built your project and have your executable, you are ready to test and debug
- testing is the process of assessing whether your software is working as you want it to
    - debugging occurs when you test and find errors in your software
