How do C++ programs get developed?
    - Step 1: Define a problem to solve
        - come up with initial idea of what you want to solve
    - Step 2: Design a solution
        - make sure its straightforward, well documented, built modularly, and can recover gracefully
    - Step 3: Write program that implements solution
    - Step 4: Compile program
    - Step 5: Link object files
    - Step 6: Test program
