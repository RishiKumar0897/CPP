    - comment code liberally
    - start with simple solutions, them layer in complexity incrementally
    - optimize for readability and maintainability

- process of making structural changes to code without changing actual functionality is called refactoring

- defensive programming is a practice where the programming tries to anticipate all the ways the software could be misused

- test early and often
