- we can also use an integrated debugger, which is provided with most IDEs

- a program state tracks:
    1. values of the variables you're using
    2. which functions have been called
    3. current point of execution within the program


- a debugger is a computer program that allows the programmer to control how a program executes
    - lets you examine different points of the program state while it's running

- integrated debuggers use the same interface as the IDE

- stepping refers to the feature of debuggers that lets us step through our code statement by statement
    - step into -> executes next statement in normal execution path
    - step over -> executes next statement in normal execution path, but it will execute an entire function without stopping, returning control only after function has been executed
    - step out -> executes all remaining code in the function CURRENTLY being executed, then returns control once function has returned
    - step back -> rewind to last step, so as to return the program to a prior state
