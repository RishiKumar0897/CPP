- finding problems via eyeballing and manually inspecting the code is inefficient and often fruitless
    - this is especially true as the complexity of your files and programs grow


- a better way to find the source of problems is to run your program and observe its behavior
    -a generalized way to do this:
        1. figure out how to reproduce the problem
        2. run the program and gather information to narrow down where the problem is
        3. repeat the prior step until you find the problem
    

- reproducing the problem means making the problem appear in a consistent manner.
- generating a set of reproduction steps can be helpful
    - reproduction steps are a list of clear and precise steps that can be followed to reproduce an issue with
        a high level or predictability
    - the goal is to be able to cause the issue to reoccur as exactly as possible over and over again
    - we find clues to determine the issue by observing behavior


- once we are able to reproduce the problem, the next step is to figure out where in the code the problem actually is
    - by reproducing the issue over and over again, we can figure out where exactly the issue arises, and thus find the source
