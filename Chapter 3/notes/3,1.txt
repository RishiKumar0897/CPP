- errors generally fall into one of two categories
    - syntax errors, or semantic/logic errors


- a syntax error occurs when you write a statement that is not valid according to C++ language grammar rules
    - this includes things like missing semicolons, mismatched parentheses or braces, etc..

- the compiler will detect syntax errors and issue warnings or halt your program's compilation
    - makes it easy to identify and fix problems


- a semantic error is an error in logic
- these occur when a statement is syntactically valid, but doesn't quite do what the programmer intended.
- some types of logic errors are caught by the compiler
    - for example: undeclared variable, type mismatches

- other semantic errors only show at runtime.
    - these errors could result in a wide variety of outcomes
        - crashing the program
        - providing a different output than expected
        - behaving differently 
    
- semantic errors are easy to spot (once you run the program and see that something is wrong)
- however, they are much harder to find and fix
