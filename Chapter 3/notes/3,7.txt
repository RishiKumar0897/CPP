- stepping is useful when you want to examine each individual line of your code in isolation

- for larger programs, it takes a long time to step through

- run to cursor -> runs the program normally until it reaches the statement selected by your cursor
- continue -> continues running the program normally until it terminates or something triggers control to return back to user again
    - start -> like continue, but only invoked when not already in a debug session

- breakpoint -> special marker that tells the debugger to stop execution at the line that has a breakpoint


- set next statement -> allows us to change the point of executino to some other statement, letting us jump the point of execution forwards and skip some code
