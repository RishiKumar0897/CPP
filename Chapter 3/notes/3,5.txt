- there are ways to mitigate the cluttering that debugging statements can cause

- we can conditionalize our debugging code using if statements (or preprocessor directives)
    - ensures that these statements only run when we are in "debug mode"

- a more modernized approach, and one that clutters your code less, is logging
    - a log is a sequential record of events that have happened, and are usually time-stamped
    - logs are written to a file on disk (a log file) so they can be reviewed later

- log files have a few advantages
    - since its a separate file, there is no clutter in your main source code
    - they can also easily be sent to other people for review

- it's better to use a 3rd party logging library
