- many tactics to help shorten the search of finding the issue
    1. commenting out code (or blocks of code)
    2. validate code flow
        - place print statements at the top of functions so you can see when (and how many times) they are called
    3. printing values
        - same deal as tactic 2, except printing intermediate values to ensure everything is working smoothly

- debug statements can clutter your code, so it's important to cleanup before pushing to prod
